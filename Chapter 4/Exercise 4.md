## Exercise 4.9 (programming)

*Implement value iteration for the gamblerâ€™s problem and solve it for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_%7Bh%7D) = 0.25 and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_%7Bh%7D) = 0.55. In programming, you may find it convenient to introduce two dummy states corresponding to termination with capital of 0 and 100, giving them values of 0 and 1 respectively. Show your results graphically, as in Figure 4.3. Are your results stable as ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta%20%5Crightarrow%200).*
